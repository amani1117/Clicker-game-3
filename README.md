#Clicker Game
Basic clicker game where you plant and grow the crop with the amount of clicks
the end of the game is when the crop is completely grown.


This was my first time learning game dev and javascript altogether. I watched hours of courses and even made a sample game https://github.com/amani1117/sonicgame.git using js and kaplay following a tutorial. 
It was an extremely fun experience trying something new I had never done before. Although I couldnt have learnt to code a whole game in just a few days. I looked up resources used AI to debug the code. 
But I've learnt alot in these few days. 
I am eager to learn and explore more of this domain it really piqued my interest. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to explore this domain and build something even as a complete beginner with zero experience.
